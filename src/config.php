 * It does nothing on its own.
 *
 * Don't edit this file, instead copy it to 'craft/config' as 'craft-commerce-multi-vendor.php'
 * and make your changes there to override default settings.
 *
 * Once copied to 'craft/config', this file will be multi-environment aware as
 * well, so you can have different settings groups for each environment, just as
 * you do for 'general.php'
